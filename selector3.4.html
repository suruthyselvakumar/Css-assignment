 <div class="">
 <div>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
 </div><br>
<div>It is always the simple that produces the marvelous. </div><br>
<div>As knowledge increases, wonder deepens.</div><br>
</div>
<p>For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of
kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.</p><br>
<p>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must
be felt with the heart.</p><br>
<p>It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. </p><br>
<p>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the
present.</p><br>
<p>Be faithful to that which exists within yourself. </p><br>
