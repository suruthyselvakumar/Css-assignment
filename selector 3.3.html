 <h1>Learn CSS 3.0 for better web design</h1><br>
 <d1>Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
</d1><br>
<d2>It is always the simple that produces the marvelous. </d2><br>
<d3>As knowledge increases, wonder deepens.</d3><br>

<p1>For beautiful eyes, look for the good in others; for beautiful lips, speak only words of
kindness; and for poise, walk with the knowledge that you are never alone.</p1><br>
<p2>The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched - they must
be felt with the heart.</p2><br>
<p3>It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. </p3><br>
<p4>Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the
present.</p4><br>
<p5>Be faithful to that which exists within yourself. </p5><br>
